  <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Hello! </h2>
  Iâ€™m <b>Jii Eu</b> who goes by <b>jioneeu</b> online.

  <br><br>
  I'm a Korea-born but raised mostly in the States -- from 3rd or 4th grade and beyond.
  I graduated from <a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">UC San Diego</a> in 2019 with <a href="http://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/major/design-interaction.html" target="_blank">B.S. Cognitive Science Spec. Human Computer and Interaction</a> degree.

  <br><br>

  Today, I'm pursuing to become a web developer but currently working in Japan as an ALT/FLT.

  <br><br>

  I'm running a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8hY3wjYlK2U9W4fqKN598Q?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank">Study with me</a> channel as a form of motivation for myself. Feel free to join and study with me :)
